# MQTT Go Application

This is a Go application that connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a specific topic, and saves the received messages to a PostgreSQL database. It also provides a REST API to retrieve the stored messages.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the containers.
4. Access the REST API at `http://localhost:8080/messages`.
5. Gracefully stop the application by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Configuration

Make sure to update the MQTT broker address, database credentials, and other configuration settings as per your environment requirements.

## Dependencies

- Gin: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- Eclipse Paho MQTT Client: MQTT client library for Go.
- Go-PG: PostgreSQL ORM for Go.
